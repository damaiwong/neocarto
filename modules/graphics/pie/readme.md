This pie chart is constructed from a CSV file storing the populations of various age groups. The chart employs a number of D3 features:

* [d3-dsv](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv) - load and parse data
* [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) - color encoding
* [d3-shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape) - layout and render arcs
