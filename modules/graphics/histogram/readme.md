# Histogram chart using d3

index2.html

This is a fork of mbostock's Histogram. What I mainly add to the original are:

Using Normal distribution
Make it work with data ranged not only from 0 to 1
Coloring bars based on their count
Add some transitions
Add refresh() method to update Hitogram's data and call it repeatedly
This example can be view on bl.ocks.org.
