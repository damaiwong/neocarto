This chart shows a histogram of a [Bates distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bates_distribution). The data is randomly generated. The values are then binned at regular intervals using D3â€™s [histogram layout](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Histogram-Layout#wiki-histogram). The *x*-axis uses a linear scale, such that the tick values appear between bars; this provides better indication that each bar represents the count of values between its surrounding tick values.
